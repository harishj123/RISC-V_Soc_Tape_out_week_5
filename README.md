# 🧠 VSD Hardware Design Program — Week 5  
## 🚀 OpenROAD Installation & RTL-to-GDSII Flow Guide

---

### 👋 Welcome!
Welcome to **Week 5** of the **VSD Hardware Design Program** 🎓  

In this module, you’ll explore **OpenROAD** — an open-source, fully automated **RTL-to-GDSII flow** for **digital integrated circuit (IC) design**.  
OpenROAD enables researchers and engineers to go from **RTL → Layout (GDSII)** with **zero manual intervention**, making it perfect for both **academic exploration** and **industrial prototyping**.
