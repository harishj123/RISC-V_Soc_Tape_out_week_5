# ðŸ§  VSD Hardware Design Program â€” Week 5  
## ðŸš€ OpenROAD Installation & RTL-to-GDSII Flow Guide

---

### ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!
Welcome to **Week 5** of the **VSD Hardware Design Program** ðŸŽ“  

In this module, youâ€™ll explore **OpenROAD** â€” an open-source, fully automated **RTL-to-GDSII flow** for **digital integrated circuit (IC) design**.  
OpenROAD enables researchers and engineers to go from **RTL â†’ Layout (GDSII)** with **zero manual intervention**, making it perfect for both **academic exploration** and **industrial prototyping**.
